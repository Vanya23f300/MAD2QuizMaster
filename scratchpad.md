## Core Functionalities Roadmap

### Authentication
1. Implement JWT-based authentication
2. Separate routes for user and admin login
3. Pre-create admin account during database initialization
4. Implement role-based access control

### Admin Dashboard Features
1. CRUD operations for:
   - Subjects
   - Chapters
   - Quizzes
   - Questions
2. User management
   - Search users
   - View user activity
3. Dashboard analytics
   - Quiz completion rates
   - User performance charts

### User Dashboard Features
1. Quiz browsing and selection
2. Quiz attempt interface
3. Timer implementation
4. Score tracking
5. Previous attempt history

## Background Jobs

### 1. Daily Reminders
- Use Celery for scheduling
- Check user activity
- Send notifications via:
  - Email
  - Google Chat Webhook
  - SMS (optional)

### 2. Monthly Activity Report
- Generate HTML report
- Include:
  - Quizzes taken
  - Average scores
  - Performance ranking
- Send via email on first of every month

### 3. Async CSV Export
- User-triggered export
  - Personal quiz history
- Admin-triggered export
  - Comprehensive user performance data

## Performance Optimization
1. Implement Redis caching
2. Cache strategies:
   - User profile
   - Quiz metadata
   - Recent quiz results
3. Set appropriate cache expiration

## Security Considerations
1. Password hashing (bcrypt)
2. JWT token management
3. Input validation
4. Rate limiting
5. CORS configuration

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for models
2. Integration tests for APIs
3. Authentication flow tests
4. Background job tests

## Deployment Preparation
1. Environment configuration
2. Docker containerization
3. Logging setup
4. Error monitoring

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning-based question recommendation
- Adaptive testing
- Multilingual support
